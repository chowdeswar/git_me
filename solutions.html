                              <p>Like you, we believe schools and educational institutions should be safe and secure. It is where our children learn about themselves and the world around them. Sadly, if our past few years are any indication, schools are not the safe places we thought they were, and anything can happen when certain circumstances facilitate a tragic situation.</p>
                              <p>However, there are things that can be done to prevent that from happening, and to keep schools as the safe places they are supposed to be. It comes in the form of video surveillance systems. The Global Reach V-Smart solutions for Schools provide a rich set of features to help monitor activities and detect and alert staff to problems on school property. It is the ideal ‘all-in-one’ surveillance solution for any size K12 school district or university.</p>
                              <h5>Benefits of V-Smart for Schools  & Education</h5>
                              <div class="content-list-bold">
                                <ul>
                                  <li><label>Maintain secure facilities</label>- College campuses feature a variety of buildings, each with their own security needs. Video surveillance helps to secure these facilities, watching for suspicious behavior and unauthorized access.</li>
                                  <li><label>Protect students</label>– Students have to cover a lot of ground when navigating their way through campus. This often involves traveling by foot, and sometimes the journey takes place late at night. Video surveillance is an invaluable tool, allowing students to wander the campus under safe watch.</li>
                                  <li><label>Deter crime</label>– Security cameras can serve as a visual deterrent to crime such as theft and break-ins.</li>
                                  <li><label>Prevent vandalism </label>– With proper video surveillance, the threat of vandalism to school property is lessened.</li>
                                  <li><label>Monitor parking lots</label>– Security cameras can prevent and deter criminal activity and theft in parking lots throughout a campus community.</li>
                                  <li><label>Help in investigations</label>– Archived surveillance footage can be used to identify individuals who have committed crimes or breached school policies.</li>
                                  <li><label>Assist in application of university policies</label>– Surveillance cameras can monitor campus activity, working to ensure that school policies are properly followed.</li>
                                  <li><label>Safety</label>– Not only do cameras help you maintain safety around your campus, they also discourage misbehavior.Conspicuously placed cameras have been shown to reduce threats of violence and vandalism drastically.</li>
                                  <li><label>Visitor monitoring </label>– One problem many schools continually struggle with is proper access control for visitors. Security cameras at entrance doors can help your administrative staff monitor visitors and make sure they are properly signed in, while still allowing your students to move freely around the campus</li>
                                  <li><label>Enhance security</label>– Surveillance cameras posted near entrances and in hallways (or labs themselves) can keep your work areas safe and free of intruders.</li>
                                  <li><label>Protect research</label>– Research projects, especially those funded by large grants, have extensive, complicated data and long-running experiments. Security cameras in your labs and storage areas can help ensure that your experiments</li>
                                  <li><label>Video Analytics </label>– Like wireless video systems, video analytics is a technological advancement that could improve the efficiency of in-bus security camera systems. Using in-camera analytics, especially license plate technology, could be of valuable assistance to bus drivers who have problems with motorists. Instead of having to rely on memory or try to read a car's tag from surveillance footage (questions like “is that a O or a zero?” could complicate issues quickly), video analytics cameras programmed to recognize car license plate numbers could make catching violators much easier.</li>
                                  <li><label>Protect bus </label>– Because of their precious cargo, a special set of traffic rules exists for both school bus drivers and other motorists (ex: motorists must stop when school buses are boarding riders or letting them off, buses must stop completely at railroad crossings, whether the barriers are down or not). Consequences for violating these rules can be dire, and therefore fines are steep. Surveillance cameras pointed outside buses can help identify motorists who illegally pass buses, or identify driver erratic and dangerous driver behavior.</li>
                                  <li><label>Build partnerships with local businesses</label>– Often, the cost of installing modern, IP video surveillance systems in buses is prohibitively expensive for most school districts. However, there is a growing number of school districts that have partnered with local security firms to have cameras installed at a discounted price (or no price at all) in exchange for advertising,a portion of ticket revenues generated from the cameras, or some other profit-generating arrangement. This type of arrangement can benefit both schools and security firms, as it provides schools with solid, reliable security, and helps video surveillance installers spread the word about their business and technologies. Are allowed to progress undisturbed and that your results are not wrongly manipulated.</li>
                                  <li><label>In-depth observations</label>– Along with being a helpful security tool, surveillance cameras can also assist in observation.Recording your experiments (where observation is required) gives you the opportunity to more closely observe your subjects.</li>

                                  <li><label>Prevent robberies</label>– The high-risk practice of bank robbery is one that will always be enticing to criminals. Banks are the institutions that store our money after all. But the proper surveillance setup can help in deterring such crimes along with providing useful images of offenders in the act.</li>
                                  <li><label>Crime investigation</label>– In instances of robbery and fraud, recorded surveillance images can be used to identify and track down suspects.</li>
                                  <li><label>Prevent check fraud</label>– IP surveillance systems with advanced video analytics such as facial recognition are helping to fight the problem of check fraud at banks by recording transaction data and capturing images of offenders.

                              <p>In situations where so many people are congregating in one space, it’s difficult for a security staff to keep physical watch over an entire venue. But with a proper video surveillance setup, cameras can monitor the entire scene, allowing the staff to respond swiftly to disturbances and suspicious activity. In other facilities, such as museums, security cameras can be used to monitor crowds and also to prevent theft of valuable works. New IP network technology is improving the effectiveness of video surveillance, helping to bring enhanced security to the entertainment industry in many areas, include the following:</p>
                              <div class="content-list-bold">
                                <ul>
                                  <li><label>Crowd control</label>– Large crowds can get testy. It takes a strong security effort to maintain order so the spirit of an event isn’t overshadowed by violence and disruptive behavior. A video surveillance network can play a significant role by providing security workers with clear views of the action, and the ability to focus in on specific scenes and individuals.</li>
                                  <li><label>Provide safe passage</label>– Entering and exiting a concert venue can be quite an ordeal, with a healthy mass of people all trying to get to the same place at the same time. Monitoring a facility's entrances and exits helps in lessening interruptions and disturbances along the way.</li>
                                  <li><label>Prevent drug use and underage drinking</label>– Cameras can monitor the crowd for illegal activities such as the consumption of alcohol by minors, and drug use.</li>

                                  <li><label>Combat terrorism </label>– It's an unfortunate fact that airports are targets for terrorist activity. For that reason, it's vitally important that airports employ extremely strict security measures. Video surveillance systems play a key role in protecting against acts of terrorism. The proper system will provide authorities with invaluable tools in their efforts to maintain the highest possible levels of security.</li>
                                  <li><label>Provide real-time surveillance to multiple departments</label>– With IP surveillance enabling digital surveillance streams to travel over the internet, operators in various airport departments such as police, customs, fire and medic, baggage, and airport operations, can all monitor the video feeds from separate PC workstations.</li>
                                  <li><label>Advanced video analytics</label>Intelligent cameras with built-in video analytics are beginning to play a significant role in airport security. These cameras utilize software algorithms to detect specific activities and scan for suspicious individuals. For instance, cameras with facial recognition technology work to help authorities find terrorist threats and marked individuals on government watch lists. Using behavioral recognition technology, cameras can be programmed to detect incidents such as left objects, congestion, reverse movement through checkpoints, and cars spending too much time parked in one spot outside of the building. With these features running through cameras themselves, the analytics operate in real-time.</li>
                                  <li><label>Protect riders</label>– It's important for riders to have confidence that the train system is safe. Many subway users are daily commuters. For them, riding the rails should be as worry-free as brushing one's teeth. Security cameras are a key part of a larger effort to provide users with a system that is safe and closely monitored for their protection.</li>
                                  <li><label>Prevent graffiti</label>– There's something about subway stations that brings graffiti artists out in force. For some, tunnel walls and train cars provide the ultimate canvas. When surveillance cameras spot such activity, officers can be quickly deployed to break things up before a full-blown mural comes to fruition. Cleaning up graffiti is an expensive task, and video surveillance helps in reducing the frequency of such activity.</li>
                                  <li><label>Monitor unsafe areas </label>– We've all heard the term, “Mind the Gap.” Many subway and train stations have sections that could prove dangerous, such as platform gaps, and any public area where there train passes by. With security cameras installed specifically to monitor such areas, accidents and injuries can be avoided.</li>
                                  <li><label>Find missing persons</label>– There have been a number of high-profile cases involving missing persons on cruise ships. Thorough cruise ship surveillance is an effective tool in solving cases involving lost or abducted individuals.</li>
                                  <li><label>Prevent violence and crime</label>– Public transportation has been a target for terrorists in recent years – bomb scares have been reported in New York City subways and the underground in London has been in a constant state of alert since their transit system experienced an attack in 2005.
